# MobileSpawn
This is a Squad mod that enables mobile spawn technique that allows players to spawn close to some vehicles, like in Post Scriptum. Currently only transport trucks have such technique.

## Description
Mobile spawn technique is implemented with the MobileSpawnComponentV2 object, which is a SceneComponent that can be added to a vehicle. All vehicles that have this component can create a mobile spawn point (BP_MobileTeamSpawn) at the MobileSpawnComponentV2 component position when the vehicle is parked and engine off.

## Usage
Use AdminChangeMap Narva_AAS_v1_ms to play with Mobile Spawn Vehicles.
